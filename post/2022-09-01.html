			<p>Yo!</p>
			<p>
			I have started SICP, using Sarabander's beautiful online edition (it really is beautiful).
			So yeah... I'll definitely not finish that by October, that would be utterly ridiculous.
			I'll aim to get at least the first one or two chapters done though. 
			</p>
			<p>
			That aside, let us talk about mechanical pencils. Specifically, the Kuru Toga. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I really like the Kuru Toga. I currently own 4 of them (one roulette, three Ghibli models) 
			and have two more being shipped here from Japan (one limited PC Pistachio, one Zaregoto). 
			They're rather expensive, but they certainly are quality - and one of them is Zaregoto 
			themed... I can't not buy that, it's Zaregoto after all, and Zaregoto is Zaregoto which is 
			my favourite series of all time. I started reading it when I was around 15, and it really 
			shaped my life from that point on, whether for better or for worse... though that's another
			story. Irrelevant to the current topic! So yes, mechanical pencils: they're the best.
