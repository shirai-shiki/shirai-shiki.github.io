			I think I'd like to learn Lisp. Along with all hundred other things 
			I have on the list to learn... I have way too much to do. Preparing for 
			Cambridge university entrance exams is enough work in itself, then pile on the
			normal exams that we need to prepare for as well (especially since I'm doing 
			four of the things, instead of three like a normal person) and then pile on 
			the stuff I want to learn anyway without all that and you get an unascendable 
			mountain as tall as the distance light travels in nine seconds. 
			</p>
			<p> 
			I think I have maths and computer science to a good standard at the moment, excluding
			the extra maths for Cambridge, and biology should be good as well. Only 
			issue is chemistry. I don't even really like chemistry, so it's understandable
			that I have a lower predicted grade than my others (A instead of A*), but
			still... I'll try raise that grade in September. Just need to revise a bit for 
			the exams when we get back. Fun (°-°). Not that I'm complaining about 
			revising, I don't mind that. Just that revising for chemistry is annoying, 
			seeing as I never even wanted to do it that much in the first place anyway. 
			I should have chosen further maths lol.
			</p>
			<p>
			So anyway, back to Lisp. I'm thinking Clojure might be good. Aphyr uses that.
			I suppose I can make time somehwere... or just absorb the information in a day
			like a hacker? Hmmmm...
			</p>
			<p>Well that's all. Bye!</p>

			Update :: I have decided to read SICP to learn arcane wizardry. Hopefully I can
			finish it in time alongside all the other stuff I'm doing 「╥﹏╥」
