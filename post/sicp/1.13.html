			<p>Proofs huh... Not sure about that, what does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction">Wikipedia</a> say?</p>
			<p><i>Mathematical induction is a mathematical proof technique. It is essentially used to prove that a statement P(n) holds for every natural number n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... ; that is, the overall statement is a sequence of infinitely many cases P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3), ... . Informal metaphors help to explain this technique, such as falling dominoes or climbing a ladder</i></p>

			<p>I see... So it's that one. So let's start with proving for <i>n=0</i> and <i>n=1</i>...</p>
			<p>...Or that's what I would do if I knew how to do that. Unfortunately, I have no idea what I'm doing. I've done some maths on paper but that's a pain to transfer here, and there's not much point posting an incomplete solution. Sorry!</p>
