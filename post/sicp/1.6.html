			This one looks a bit tougher...
			</p>
			<p>
			It seems like it should work fine, but putting it into the REPL
			makes an infinite loop so...

			Given that it recurses infinitely, we can assume that <i>sqrt-iter</i>
			is evaluated every time, even when <i>(good-enough? guess x)</i> is true.
			</p>
			<p>
			So from that we can deduce that the function <i>new-if</i> evaluates all
			of its arguments before executing.
