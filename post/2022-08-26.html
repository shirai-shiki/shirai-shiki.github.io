			<p>Hello there!</p>
			<p>This is the first post I've made here. I doubt that anyone 
			will find this page for quite some time however, so, to you in
			the future, congratulations! How did you get here?</p>
			<p>In essence, this is to be a place for me to leave whatever
			 I feel like... Just normal blog stuff I suppose?</p>
			<p>In case you were wondering why I chose this design for the 
			site... That would be because it can be stored in a small space,
			doesn't look completely awful, and it loads quick. (Not just
			because	it's really easy to make... it's not just laziness, I
			swear!)</p>
